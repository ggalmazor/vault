# Vault

Vault is a simple IoC container for DI written for Java8.

# To do & review

 - Support Lifecycle management on Vaults (start/stop)
 - Support for Suppliers returning more than one instance? Maybe through typed Tuples? This could be nonsensical... Maybe the supplier depends on other artifacts that are inter-dependant... ah, fuckit.
